This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The dataset consists of medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other clinical features. Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values and feature selection are performed to ensure accurate model performance. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is used to analyze patterns in the data and predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease. Model performance is evaluated using cross-validation and accuracy metrics. The project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early detection of heart disease and support medical decision-making.
Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe health complications. Traditional diagnosis methods rely heavily on medical expertise and extensive clinical tests, which can be time-consuming and costly. There is a need for an automated and efficient system that can analyze patient health data and accurately predict the risk of heart disease. This project aims to use Python and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that assists in identifying individuals who may be at risk of heart disease at an early stage.

Objectives

To collect and preprocess heart disease data for analysis.

To handle missing values and select relevant medical features.

To implement a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

To evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and cross-validation techniques.

To predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient health parameters.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in supporting medical diagnosis.
